## Go.Data SITREP Toolbox for ArcGIS Pro
Pro Toolbox
{: .label .label-purple }

[`GoData ArcGISPro SITREP`](https://github.com/LangsterGA/godata2arcgis) toolbox was developed by the Go.Data team to automate the process of generating situation report (SITREP) maps during an outbreak investigation managed with Go.Data. The toolbox allows a GIS user to extract raw case and contact data and generate pre-programmed summary data to develop 10 different typical SITREP maps - bypassing the need to learn how to retrieve data from within the Go.Data system or wait for data to be distributed from response team members.
